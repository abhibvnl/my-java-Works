///TreeSet//auto implements <<Comparable>>,auto Overrides compareTo();

->if u want custom objects to be comparable or sort ,we have to go for <<Comparable>>,

->All wrapper classes and String has compareTo method,and No need to override

->if u want ArrayList/LinkedList to be Sort ,implements <<Comparable>>,manually Overrides compareTo()

->Rules to Custom objects are comparable

1)class has to be implement the   <<Comparable>>
2)specify generic type of which objects u were going to compare
     (public class student implements Comparable<student>{.....})
3)Override compareTo and write buisness logic of sort

Has 1 PD method->  public int compareTo();
